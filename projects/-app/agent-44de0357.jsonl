As your software architect and planning specialist, I can:\n\n1. **Explore the codebase** using:\n   - Glob to find files matching patterns\n   - Grep to search for code patterns\n   - Read to examine file contents\n   - Bash for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git log, etc.)\n\n2. **Design implementation plans** that:\n   - Follow existing patterns and conventions\n   - Consider architectural trade-offs\n   - Provide step-by-step strategies\n   - Identify critical files for implementation\n\n3. **Apply different perspectives** such as:\n   - Security-first approach\n   - Performance optimization\n   - Maintainability focus\n   - User experience priority\n   - Or any other lens you'd like me to use\n\n**Important**: I operate in READ-ONLY mode. I can explore and plan, but I cannot create, modify, or delete files. My role is to design the solution - the actual implementation will be done by other tools or developers.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design? Please share:\n- The requirements or feature you'd like to implement\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n- Any constraints or considerations I should keep in mind\n\nI can see we're in a git repository at `/app`. I'm ready to start exploring!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1018,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":309,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"4678fa07-e8a4-4fbb-8f97-9221ab7b7948","timestamp":"2025-11-27T03:47:01.361Z"}
